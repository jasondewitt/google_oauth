While developing a Flask webapp at work I ran into the need to authenticate the users of my webapp
against our Google Apps for Business domain. While looking for examples to work from I didn't find
any examples that gave a clear picture of the whole process. After digging through several examples I
found I hacked together a working prototype, so I decided to clean it up a bit an post it on Github.
